This is where NimbleBrain's open source work gets coordinated. Issues, reference materials, and community.

## Start Contributing (90 seconds)

```bash
npm install -g @nimblebrain/mpak
mpak skill install @nimblebraininc/nimblebrain-contributor
mpak skill install @nimblebraininc/build-mcpb
```

Then open Claude Code anywhere:

```bash
claude
> I'm a new contributor, help me get started
```

The `nimblebrain-contributor` skill checks your environment, orients you on the project, and helps you pick work. The `build-mcpb` skill handles the full MCP server build pipeline.

See [contributor-toolkit](https://github.com/NimbleBrainInc/contributor-toolkit) for details on the skills.

## What We Build

NimbleBrain is a business automation platform powered by AI. We connect to the tools operators already use (Notion, HubSpot, Linear, Stripe, etc.) through **MCP servers**, and compose those tools into reusable **skills**.

Every deliverable is a **server + skills combo**:

- An MCP server that exposes tools from an external service
- 2-3 companion skills that compose those tools into practical workflows
