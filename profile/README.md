# NimbleBrain

**The first business automation platform you talk to.**

No flowcharts. No setup. Just describe what you need, and Nira, your AI operations assistant, builds and runs it for you.

## What is NimbleBrain?

Most automation tools make you think like a programmer: dragging boxes, connecting nodes, debugging flows. NimbleBrain is different.

**You talk. Nira does the rest.**

- "Send me a Slack summary of all open support tickets every morning"
- "When a new lead comes in, check if they're in our CRM and alert the sales team"
- "Screen resumes against this job description and rank the top 10"

Nira understands what you need, connects to your tools, and handles it automatically.
