# Priority Levels

All issues in the [Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/NimbleBrainInc/projects/10) are triaged using priority levels P0 through P3. P0 is the highest priority.

| Priority | Label | Meaning | Expected Response |
|----------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **P0** | Critical | Outage, security vulnerability, or blocks all other work | Drop everything. Resolve today. |
| **P1** | High | Must ship this week. Key features, important bugs, blockers for others. | Start within 1-2 days. |
| **P2** | Medium | Should ship soon. Planned work, non-blocking improvements. | Complete within 2-4 weeks. |
| **P3** | Low | Nice to have. Minor improvements, polish, long-term ideas. | This quarter or later. |

## Guidelines

- **New issues start without a priority.** They get triaged during review.
- **Most issues are P2.** If you're unsure, P2 is the safe default.
- **P0 should be rare.** If everything is P0, nothing is.
- **No priority is fine temporarily.** Unprioritized issues sit in the backlog until triaged.
- **Priority can change.** A P3 becomes P1 when a customer hits it. Re-triage as context shifts.
